The dough is pressed into carved molds that can be used for wall decorations. When turned out onto the cookie sheet, the picture appears as its mirror image, hence the name. In the Sinterklass season they are available in 2/3 cookie size to huge thick men and women up to 1 pound known as lovers. If molds are not available, roll dough to desired thickness and use gingerbread man cutter or other cutter shapes. They are great to make ahead around Christmas because they last a long time.",

In the Sinterklass season they are available in 2/3 cookie size to huge thick men and women up to 1 pound known as lovers. If molds are not available, roll dough to desired thickness and use gingerbread man cutter or other cutter shapes. They are great to make ahead around Christmas because they last a long time.",

The original recipe calls for regular vinegar which, for me, gives a bland pie. You can substitute apple cider vinegar, leaving out the lemon extract, for a very good taste. Be sure to let the pie crust cool before filling.\"",

As a tradition, Grandma has made Pomanders for us nearly every Christmas, but they are great year-round! The longer you let these no bake cookies set the better they taste. So, make them a few weeks before you plan to eat them, hide them from your family and friends, and have patience! Store in tight containers for two to three weeks to let the flavors fully cultivate and intensify. You can eat these right after they're made, but for best taste let them sit at least two weeks.",
